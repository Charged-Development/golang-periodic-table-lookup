# how to use

Make sure you have golang installed, if you don't installed it [here](https://golang.org/doc/install)

Now that you have golang installed you can make sure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed and type `git clone https://github.com/Charged-Development/golang-periodic-table-lookup.git` into a cmd.

Then in the cmd type `cd golang-periodic-table-lookup`

Now in that same cmd type `go get github.com/stretchr/objx`

Now type in that same cmd `go run main.go`

If you want this to be an exe type `go build main.go`
